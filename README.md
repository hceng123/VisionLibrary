# VisionLibrary
My Vision library for AOI. It is based on OpenCV and Boost. It provides learning, inspection, alignment and record management utilities.
Before build the project, need to build the OpenCV, and set the include path and library path to the VisionLibrary project.
The boost library is using 1.59.0, i didn't upload to git because it is too big, to build need to download boost and put the .\ExtLibs\boost_1_59_0.
